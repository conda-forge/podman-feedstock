  summary: 'Podman: A tool for managing OCI containers and pods.'
  description: >
    Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of containers. Podman is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management that is also contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers,
    pods, container images, and volumes.
